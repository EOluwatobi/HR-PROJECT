### Project Title: Incubator Hub HR Data Analysis


### Overview
Having undergone a 3-month training with The Incubator Hub on data analysis, this project is assigned as a case study of a real-life scenario of the HR data of an organization with focus on employee attrition which provides valuable insights into workforce stability, engagement and the effectiveness of retention strategies within an organization. 


### Purpose and Objectives
The purpose of this study is to determine the attrition rate of employees in the organization, discuss the possible reason for this and recommend solution to bring to its barest minimal the attrition rate of the employees in the organization.


### Tools and Functions
- The tools used in the project are: 
- Microsoft Excel- which houses our data and used for cleaning data.
- Powerbi-which is used building interactive dashboard and visualizations.
In Powerbi, DAX functions (calculated columns and measures) were implemented to perform dynamic aggregations to provide more insights to the data.
